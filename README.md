Relevant code for the project titled: A fingertip phantom to study the effect of biomechanics in the perception of material stiffnesses. 
Submitted for the degree of Masters of Science in Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering.

This repository contains the code for the data processing and analysis stage of the above project.
The code has been separated into three folders, one for each type of data acquisition method, with all the necessary scripts and functions needed to process and analyse the data from that specific type of test in one place.
The sections are:
   1. Tap Testing
   2. Instron Testing
   3. Sensor Linearity Testing

Specificities on the functioning/purpose of the code in this repository can be found in the project report.
